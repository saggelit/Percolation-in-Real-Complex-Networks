THESIS DIPLOMA - Real (Big) Data
Abstract

This dissertation describes complex collaboration networks which are based on real complex data (real complex networks). The data analyzed,
relate to applicants and inventors of these patents and have been extracted from the OECD Citations Database and OECD Regpat, including entries 
from 1978 to 2016. The aim of the whole analysis is to determine what influences the configuration of the networks, to observe their temporal 
evolution and to isolate the moment of creation of the giant component.

Thus, the study was divided into two stages. The first stage concerns networks with the yearly data at our disposal, initially indiscriminately 
and then grouped in five main categories (larger in terms of the volume of their data). These categories are related to "Human Necessities" (A), 
"Performing Operations; Transporting" (B), â€œChemistry; Metallurgy" (C), "Physics" (G) and "Electricity" (H). The second stage concerns networks 
per time window, again initially without and then with categorization. The time windows extend to a depth of four years, with each subsequent 
time window being created in one year time step.

Following the renewal of each network, we create the corresponding graph that depicts the size of the five largest clusters depending on the number 
of edges that exist within the network at any given time. We observe the evolving configuration of these clusters chronologically as well as the 
moment that the two largest clusters merge, creating the giant component that can no longer be surpassed.

The behavior of networks seems to differ significantly between applicants and inventors. The differences observed between the configuration of 
the general networks in comparison to the networks referenced to one patent class at a time are very important as well. These variations may have 
arisen due to a number of factors, one of which is the many subcategories that a patent may belong to. The investigation, however, of the 
subcategories however, is not the subject of this particular thesis diploma.
